                    Ringo is just a baby; it essentially only understands two things: artists you like and artists that you want to listen to,
                    e.g.
                </p>
                <pre>I like (artist)</pre>
                <p>
                    When you like an Artist, Ringo will recommend another one to you, taking you on a journey of discovery. Behind the scenes
                    Ringo is recording your likes and using them (and the likes of others) to make better recommendations
                    to you.
                </p>
                <pre>Play (artist)</pre>
                <p>
                    If you have a Spotify Premium account you can authorize Ringo to play you music on Spotify (the music plays on your device).
                </p>
