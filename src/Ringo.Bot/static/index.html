        <p>
            Welcome to the Ringo bot preview! You can chat with Ringo on Slack. Microsoft
            Teams is coming soon.

            Ringo is just a baby; it essentially only
            understands two things: artists you like and artists that you want to 
            listen to, e.g.
        </p>
        <pre>I like Madonna</pre>
        <p>
                When you like an Artist, Ringo will recommend another one to you, taking
                you on a journey of discovery. Behind the scenes Ringo is recording your
                likes and using them (and the likes of others) to make better recommendations
                to you.
        </p>
        <pre>Play Madonna</pre>
        <p>
            If you have a Spotify Premium account you can authorize Ringo to play you
            music on Spotify (the music plays on your device).

            As you preview Ringo we would love your feedback. What would you like Ringo 
            to understand? What would you like Ringo to do?
