Hi, I'm Ringo! 👋 To get started, open Spotify and start playing music. Then type \"Start\".

Ringo syncs your music with friends, no matter where they are on the planet. You and your friends will each need a Spotify Premium account, and the Spotify App open and active (used recently).

**Quick start**

To talk to Ringo you must DM (direct message) or mention @ringo.

Start a Station based on whatever is playing on your Spotify right now

`start`

Join a Station to sync your Spotify with everyone else who is listening to this Station.

`join #(hashtag)`

`join @(username)`

The first time you play, Ringo will ask you to authorize Spotify. Follow the instructions carefully until Spotify starts playing the playlist.

Type **more help** for more commands and tricks.
