Ringo is a bot you use to listen to music with friends, no matter where they are on the planet. You and your friends will each need a Spotify Premium account, and the Spotify App open and active (used recently).

**Quick start**

```play (Playlist name)          // Start playing a Playlist.

join (@username)              // Start playing the Playlist that (@username) is playing.```

**Getting started**

To get started, ask Ringo to play a playlist. For example:

```play Michael Jackson

@ringo play Michael Jackson     // If you are in a group channel, you will need to @ringo```

The first time you play, Ringo will ask you to Authorize Spotify. Follow the instructions carefully until Spotify starts playing the playlist. Next, message a friend to join you so that they can listen too! They ask Ringo bot to join in by typing:

```join @your_username

@ringo join @your_username      // If you are in a group channel, you will need to @ringo```

Once they have authorized Spotify, their Spotify app will start playing music in perfect sync with you!
