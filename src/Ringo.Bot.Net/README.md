## Cristian algorithm

Cristian's algorithm works between a process P, and a time server S ‚Äî connected to a source of UTC 
(Coordinated Universal Time). Put simply:

    P requests the time from S
    After receiving the request from P, S prepares a response and appends the time T from its own clock.
    P then sets its time to be T + RTT/2

This method assumes that the RTT (Round Trip Time) is split equally between request and response, which 
may not always be the case but is a reasonable assumption on a LAN connection.

Further accuracy can be gained by making multiple requests to S and using the response with the shortest 
RTT.
